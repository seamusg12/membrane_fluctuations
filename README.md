scripts for grid based fourier analysis of simulated membranes ( see also mferguder )

Fourier.py: 

            INPUTS - Arrays of (head, tail, and surface) positions and box sizes

            OUTPUTS - Arrays of Fourier coefficients modulus squared for shape fluctuations and (anti-symmetrized and symmetrized, parallel and transverse) director fluctuations
